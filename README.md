## ABOUT

In [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python/2023-05), I tackled a wide range of programming exercises that covered fundamental concepts. This included functions, variables, conditions, loops, objects, file I/O, and more. These exercises, inspired by real-world problems, provided me with practical experience and helped me build a strong foundation in Python programming.
